	Expect.pm v1.09

Expect requires IO::Tty and IO::Stty, also available from CPAN.
There is a Bundle::Expect available that installs everything for
you.

If you prefer manual installation, the usual

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

should work. I haven't implemented a make test for either IO::Stty or
Expect.  It would probably be wise to read the docs on IO::Tty before
doing a make install with it.

The Expect for Perl module was inspired more by the functionality the
Tcl tool provides than any previous Expect-like tool such as Comm.pl
or chat2.pl.

The Tcl version of expect is a creation of Don Libes (libes@nist.gov).
The Tcl Expect home page is http://expect.nist.gov/.  Don has written
an excellent in-depth tutorial of the Tcl Expect, which is _Exploring
Expect_.  It is the O'reilly book with the monkey on the front.  Don has
several references to other articles on the Expect web page.

Please note: I just took over this module and added new functionality
that isn't documented anywhere (well, there are some sentences added
to the .pods, but they aren't that helpful).  That will change in the
next few weeks, expect some more documentation then.  I already
started a new FAQ (Expect_FAQ.pod), so please let me know if there's
something you'd like to see answered there that isn't.

Please also check the old FAQ and tutorial directory.
