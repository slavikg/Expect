	To install Expect you will also need IO::Stty which will be in the same
directory as you found this package, currently at ftp://ftp.habit.com/pub/perl.
You will also need IO::Tty which can be found in Graham Barr's directory on any
CPAN site.

	This version is significantly changed from the last. I'm in hopes that
through use of the tutorial it will be less of a nightmare for people to 
understand. Please let me know if there's something you'd like to see
that isn't documented.

	Thanks,
