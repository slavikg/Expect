=head1 NAME

Expect.pm (1.08) - Perl Expect interface

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Expect.pm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Expect module is a successor of Comm.pl and a descendent of Chat.pl. It
more closely ressembles the Tcl Expect language than its predecessors. It
does not contain any of the networking code found in Comm.pl. I suspect this
would be obsolete anyway given the advent of IO::Socket and external tools
such as netcat.

Expect.pm is an attempt to have more of a switch() & case: feel to make 
decision processing more fluid. three separate types of debugging have 
been implemented to make code production easier.

It is now possible to interconnect multiple file handles (and processes) much
like Tcl's expect. An attempt was made to enable all the features of Tcl's
expect without forcing Tcl on the victim programmer :-) .

=head1 CAVEATS

Expect.pm was designed to be generally portable across Unixes.

1. The operating system must include  ptys. This excludes non-Unix operating
systems as far as I know.

2. The operating system must be POSIX compliant and include the Perl
5 POSIX.pm module. The Fcntl.pm module is also used. My understanding
is that there is no POSIX for Microsoft stuff. Bummer.

3. Perl 5.00401+ must be used. This module has been tested with 5.001 and
5.003 under Linux and SunOS 5 and worked fine, but with the new IO::Pty
support 5.00401 is required. Expect itself doesn't require this in case
at some point IO::Pty should become backwards compatible with earlier versions
of Perl. Please read the FAQ if you have trouble before going any further.

The old perl 4 Comm.pl was only compatible with SunOS 4 and 5 due to 
heavy use of ioctl() calls. It is the author's wish that this lack of
portability be fixed as much as possible.

=head1 CAVEATS PART 2

Tty settings are a major pain to keep track of. If you find
unexpected behavior such as double-echoing or a frozen session doublecheck
the documentation for default settings. When in doubt handle them yourself
using the exp_stty() and manual_stty() functions. As of .98 you shouldn't
have to worry about stty settings getting fouled unless you use interconnect
or intentionally change them (like doing -echo to get a password).

If you foul your terminal's tty settings kill any hung processes and enter stty
sane at a shell prompt. This should make your terminal manageable again.

=head1 BUGS

This module has not been tested on a great variety of platforms and
doesn't seem to have a wide spread yet.  You may want to check the 
modules homepage at http://sourceforge.net/projects/expectperl/

I have added the multi-match functionality and also now taken over
maintainance and further development of Expect.pm. There will be a
complete clean rewrite in the near future (cannot promise any date)
that may break some backward-compatibility for cleaner design.  For
example, I would like to break it up somewhat, probably move the
interconnect-stuff to a separate module to slim down the core
functionality.  I still want to keep it as close to Tcl/Expect as
possible to make switching real easy.
	
=head1 CONTRIBUTORS

There are still a few lines of code dating back to the inspirational
Comm.pl and Chat.pl modules without which this would not have been possible.
Kudos to Eric Arnold <Eric.Arnold@Sun.com> and Randal 'Nuke your NT box with
one line of perl code' Schwartz<merlyn@stonehenge.com> for making these
available to the perl public.

As of .98 I think all the old code is toast. No way could this have been done
without it though. Special thanks to Graham Barr for helping make sense of
the IO::Handle stuff as well as providing the highly recommended IO::Tty 
module.
